Packages are containers for classes.
A package is just a folder

A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:

Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
User-defined Packages (create your own packages)


Built-in Packages
The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment.
Import a Class
If you find a class you want to use, for example, the Scanner class, which is used to get user input, write the following code:

Import a Package
There are many packages to choose from. In the previous example, we used the Scanner class from the java.util package. This package also contains date and time facilities, random-number generator and other utility classes.

To import a whole package, end the sentence with an asterisk sign (*). The following example will import ALL the classes in the java.util package:

Example
import java.util.*;


User-defined Packages
To create your own package, you need to understand that Java uses a file system directory to store them. Just like folders on your computer:

package mypack;
class MyPackageClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("This is my package!");
  }
}
